		<b>RetroAchievements.org</b> is a community who collaborate and compete to earn custom-made achievements in classic games through emulation.
		Achievements are made by and for the community.
		We provide various custom-built emulators for you to use which will detect when you have completed various challenges.
		Once logged in, the emulators will post the achievements you've completed back to the site, so you can check and compare your progress to your friends.<br><br>
		
		Here's an example of RAGens, playing Streets of Rage 2. You will see two leaderboard attempt counters (bottom-right), one achievement popping and finally the overlay (press ESC):<br>

Unfortunately it is illegal to host or distribute copyright ROMs. To extract the ROM file from your cartridges, you can use a tool such as the <a href='https://www.retrode.org/'>Retrode</a> or similar, then you can use the ROM file with our emulators. Other websites host ROM files that you could use with our emulators, but we do not condone downloading or playing ROMs for games you do not own.</p>";

You would have to complete the game and get the achievements first time, just like it were on the original console. In reward for this, you will earn both the standard and the hardcore achievement, in effect earning double points! A regular game worth 400 points, is now worth 800 if you complete it fully on hardcore! For example: if you complete the game fully for 400 points, you then have the opportunity to earn another 400 on hardcore.</p>";
