# V1 Web API - Code Freeze

The V1 Web API (`API_*.php` files in this directory) is in **permanent maintenance mode**.

## What this means

- Bug fixes are acceptable and will be reviewed.
- New features will not be accepted.
- Breaking changes are not permitted.

## Adding new API functionality

New API endpoints should be implemented in the V2 API, which uses the [JSON:API](https://jsonapi.org/) specification. See `app/Api/V2` for examples.
