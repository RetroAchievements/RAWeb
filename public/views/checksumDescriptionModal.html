<h1>Checksum</h1>

<p>A checksum, or a hash, uniquely determines your ROM. Specifying the checksum of your ROM can help the developer reproduce the issue or even determine if a particular ROM is incompatible with the set.</p>

<h4>Where can I find this?</h4>

<p>This is dependent on whatever emulator you're using. If you're using RetroArch, this information can be found by entering the RetroArch menu while your ROM is loaded and scroll down to Information. It will be the long alphanumeric string after "RetroAchievements Hash".</p>

<p>If you're using RALibRetro, this information can be found by going into RetroAchievements > View Game Hash.</p>
