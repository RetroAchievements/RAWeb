<h1>Issue</h1>

<p>There are two different ways in which an achievement is considered broken. Use this dropdown to indicate which of these two types, documented below, is applicable to your situation.</p>

<h4>Triggered at the Wrong Time</h4>

<p>Use this when an achievement notification appears in your emulator at a time different than what is implied in the achievement's description. For instance, if the triggered achievement asks you to collect 10 of a collectable but appears when you haven't done so, then you would use this type.</p>

<h4>Doesn't Trigger</h4>

<p>Use this when an achievement notification <i>doesn't</i> appear when you have done what the achievement's description asked you to do. For instance, if the achievement you expected to trigger asks you to collect 10 of a collectable and you got 11, then you would use this type if you don't see the notification appear.</p>

<h4>What if the achievement triggered but doesn't show up as earned for me on the site?</h4>

<p>This normally indicates a network issue&mdash;which is to say that either your connection was interrupted while the achievement triggered or the site itself is down. <strong>Please do not create a ticket if this has happened to you!</strong> Instead, please request a manual unlock on the RetroAchievements Discord server and provide the screenshot created when the achievement triggered or some other form of proof.</p>
